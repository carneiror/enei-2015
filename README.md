# Web performance: the good, the bad and the ugly

A 101 talk about performance: page load and runtime CSS/JS.

### Page load
The subject was [enei.pt](http://sgtcarneiro.github.io/enei-2015/website/v1). The original scores on [webpagetest](http://www.webpagetest.org/) and [pagespeed insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) were pretty bad and during this presentation I tried to improve this scores.
